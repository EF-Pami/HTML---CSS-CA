Title: SQUARE EYES movie streaming website

Images source: All movie images gotten from cinematerial.com
used imagecompressor.com to resize images in order to meet up with image size criteria but some images still more than 200kb.

Self-inspirational written codes as well as deep online research from sources as youtube tutorial videos, course outline video, student and teacher support all play an important role in the choice of code for this work.

A change of mobile and small screen device design in order to fit the building of the website, mobile homepage device slightly different from final product; images are display in a column for the website but are display in a row for the design. A resize of the images to fit the row display had poor visual quality hence I decided to display them in a column form in the home page.
