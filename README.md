The end product of this project was a movie streaming website where users could login and purchase different categories of movies with different age categories for entertainment purposes. The project consistuted of different parts and i had to use different languages for the project; at first it was build using mainly HTML and CSS for the first part of it while using downloaded images for the movie posters.
